Market & Store Data Analysis: Revenue, Marketing, and Expansion Insights

📌 Project Overview
This project explores market and store data to analyze revenue trends, marketing spend efficiency, and business expansion strategies. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), I perform EDA, data cleaning, and visualizations to uncover how location, startup type, and marketing strategies influence business success.

🔍 Key Features

✔ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing using Pandas

✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns

✔ Visualizations of revenue, marketing impact, and business growth

✔ Insights on expansion strategies and market challenges

📊 Key Insights

📌 Marketing Spend & Revenue: Stores with higher marketing spend tend to generate more revenue, but the correlation varies by market.

📌 New Expansion Performance: Newly expanded stores show mixed results—some outperform older stores, while others struggle.

📌 Regional Trends: Certain sales regions consistently drive higher revenue, indicating location plays a role.

📌 Company Size & Stability: Larger companies with more years in the market generally have stable revenue, while startups face more challenges.

📂 Dataset

The analysis is based on two datasets:

Market Table: Contains information on company size, startup type, marketing strategy, and years in the market.
Store Table: Includes store location, revenue, marketing spend, and expansion status.
